## Abstract

The scene cuts to the offices of Delorean - the hottest time-transport
startup in town. Beneath the glitzy face of the fast-growing company, we
find a defeated engineering team struggling with a large Rails monolith,
complete with the battle scars of anemic domain models, spaghetti code,
and cut corners. The team is shipping fewer features while battling
increasing rates of unexpected regressions. How do they begin to break
up this monolith into services?

Join the team as they turn to three Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
techniques to develop key architecture insights to understand their
system as a cohesive whole. Using code samples adapted from real Rails
codebases, we'll learn important DDD patterns and refactoring techniques
to begin transporting the monolith's underlying architecture into a
well-designed, cleanly segregated, and service-oriented future!
