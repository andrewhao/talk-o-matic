## The Consensus-Building Magic of Nemawashi

Gulp -- it's almost time for the Big Meeting. The one where you need to sell your Big Architecture Proposal in front of your peers and senior leadership. Your heart is in your throat as you calm your racing nerves. You have no idea how people are going to receive your idea. You take a second to take a deep breath and step into the room. Here goes nothing...

Hold on! What if I told you there was a way to ensure you knew the outcome of this very meeting before you stepped foot into the room? What if there was a better way to circulate your tech spec and get approval without dragging it through a hundred wandering comments? That magic can indeed happen through the Japanese process of "nemawashi", the art of building advance consensus through private outreach.

Join us as we learn how to apply nemawashi to everyday activities in collaborative technology orgs like ours. We'll identify situations where nemawashi is - and isn't - appropriate to practice. We'll talk about ways to work with leadership and peers so you have as much information as you need to craft the most compelling, successful proposals for technology and product decisions. You'll leave feeling empowered with skills to successfully pitch and get the buy-in for your next Big Proposal!

## The WIP Trap: Is My Team Running Too Hot?

It's tempting to keep the entire team utilized all the time. New projects emerge all the time, 

But... WIP (Work in Progress) can be the death knell of a team that's running too close to its utilization. In this talk, we'll look at a fictional team at Acme Corp



## The Pyramid Principle: Barbara Minto's Secret Weapon for Devastatingly Effective Docs

Uh-oh, you wrote another meandering doc where your reviewers lost the plot. Maybe you just sent out a long-winded email announcement that was met with more confusion. Or your tech spec is met with that famous question: "what are we solving here again?"

What if there was a way to focus your ideas and communicate them clearly and concisely? Barbara Minto did just that in 1985 in her seminal book, _The Pyramid Principle_ and its now-famous SCQA framework. How might we learn from her so that we can be effective written communicators in a remote work world?

Join us as we help a beleaguered tech lead edit their team's product spec by learning about the key components of the SCQA framework. We'll learn how to deliver the core ideas first, build logical, deductive arguments, and win approval and achieve alignment along the way. You'll leave with a clear understanding of how to uplevel your technical communication with leadership and your colleagues!
