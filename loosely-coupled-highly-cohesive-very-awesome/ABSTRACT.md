Highly Cohesive, Loosely Coupled & Very Awesome

or:

Built to last: A domain-driven approach to beautiful systems
------------------------------------------------------------

It's time to face the music: your code is a mess. No matter how much you try to slice at the Big Ball of Mud with patterns out of the *Refactoring* book, the refactored code just seems to pile on endless layers of indirection that tower over your fellow developers, adding complexity instead of clearing it away. You can't help but feel you're missing some key insight to getting your growing legacy codebase back in order.

In this talk, we'll move beyond the prescriptive refactoring recipes we've been taught to follow, zoom out and think about beautiful systems a different way: in terms of cohesion and coupling. Using a strategic Domain-Driven Design tool called Context Mapping, we'll learn new ways to organize our systems that match business objectives and organizational hierarchy. We'll learn how these design outcomes lead to resilient, stable code. Finally, with real code samples, we'll look at a domain-oriented approach to organizing code in a Rails codebase, applying incremental refactoring steps to build a codebase that is built to last.
