Loosely Coupled, Highly Cohesive, Very Awesome
----------------------------------------------

A Domain-Driven approach to beautiful systems.

"Ugh!" you cry out - "this code is a mess." No matter how much you try to
slice your code with patterns out of the *Refactoring* book, the
refactored code just seems to pile on endless layers of indirection that
tower over developers, hurting more than they help. You can't help but
feel you're missing some key insight to getting your growing legacy
spaghetti code back in order.

In this talk, we'll try to think about beautiful systems a different way -
in terms of symmetry, cohesion, and coupling. Using tools and concepts borrowed
from Domain-Driven Design, we'll compare and contrast two approaches to
refactoring systems. You will emerge better equipped to think about your
codebase from a business domain-oriented level, and have the tools to
transform your codebase into one that is loosely coupled, highly
cohesive, and very awesome.
