## Carbon Five Dev Night

Help! Your code base is doomed. Generations of engineers have come and gone, leaving different ideas and concepts and naming conventions scattered through the system. Working in this system is a slog and a drag on morale.

What if I told you there was an alternate reality for your systems - one where concepts were expressed cleanly and powerfully? What if I told you there was a future where your teams managed the evolution of these system concepts, taming the dragons of entropy and changing business requirements that lie within?

You too can learn the secrets of Using The Right Name through the time-tested wisdom of Domain-Driven Design. In this talk, we’ll see how other scholars in other fields think about naming things, and we’ll apply those same ideas to software design. We’ll learn about some traps to avoid when naming things in software, and finally we’ll get real practical and talk about some design tools and team practices you can implement on your own teams to build software that’s elegant, clear, and consistent!
