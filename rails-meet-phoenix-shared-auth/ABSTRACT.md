Phoenix and Rails Auth APIs
---------------------------

## Talk Abstract

Introducing Phoenix and Elixir into an existing Rails ecosystem can be
hard to do. One of the first problems you'll encounter is how to share
authentication schemes between your applications. The world is so
confusing with JWTs, OAuth, and other fancy authentication schemes, but
they all require tons of extra work. What if there were something simpler you could use so you could get up to speed in Elixir even faster?

Well, there is another way! In this session, we'll investigate the code
tricks you can do to share sessions between Phoenix and Rails via cookie
sharing. We'll demonstrate code changes you'll have to make between the
two systems, and in the end you'll leave with an idea on how to
share authentication between your own apps - and the confidence to get
your system up and running faster than ever.

A story of a little side project that got to know the new kid at school:
Phoenix. This is the story of their friendship.
