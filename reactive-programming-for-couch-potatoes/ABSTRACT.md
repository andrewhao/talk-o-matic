## Talk Abstract

Let’s build a pedometer with RxJS - and learn about functional reactive programming concepts and tools in the process! Subsequently, we’ll transport our pedometer to a Cycle.js frontend app, illustrating how its Dialogue abstraction architecture is a great fit for reactive applications.

## Talk Description

You’ve heard the yapping about functional reactive programming and how it’s the bee’s knees. But… you can’t figure out how it works, and all the math-talk and theory jargon that comes up on Wikipedia is confusing to you. Fear not! Together, we’ll go through the concepts of streams, functions, and data flow. We’ll take the concepts apart with diagrams and explain them in plain English.

With this newfound knowledge, we’ll build ourselves a pedometer for our phones with an HTML5 device accelerometer and RxJS (a Javascript FRP library). We will see for ourselves how data is passed, transformed, and modeled in a reactive paradigm. Finally, we’ll place our pedometer into a Cycle.js app and see how its Dialogue abstraction makes writing great elegant, decoupled reactive applications easy.

## Notes

This talk will be: 20% reactive, functional programming principles 40% RxJS tooling, code samples (building the pedometer) 40% Cycle.js app (building the UI)

I believe that reactive programming is a great starting place for folks looking to get into functional and functional-style programming, and I enjoy explaining the concepts that can get them there. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of how to begin implementing Reactive code in otherwise vanilla callback-based or Promise-based apps.
