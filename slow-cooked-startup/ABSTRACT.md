Slow Cooked Startup
-------------------

## Talk Abstract

How do you turn your side project from something you just like to hack on during weekends, to something that generates real revenue, delights users and provides you that warm fuzzy feeling you've built something the world can benefit from?

Join us in an informal conversation about the humble days of my own side project, [Wejoinin](http://www.wejoinin.com), and how my co-founder and I finally got the guts to try to make it profitable to run. We'll discuss the decisions we had to make early on to make sure it didn't burn us out, how to say no to users and yes to features of real value, and how to correctly harness the magic of low expectations to build something great.
