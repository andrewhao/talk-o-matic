Slow Cooked Startup
-------------------

## Talk Abstract

How do you turn your side project from something you just like to hack on during weekends, to something that generates real revenue, delights users and provides you that warm fuzzy feeling you've built something the world can benefit from?

Join us in an informal conversation about the humble days of my own side project, [Wejoinin](http://www.wejoinin.com), and how my co-founder and I finally got the guts to try to make it profitable to run. We'll discuss the decisions we had to make early on to make sure it didn't burn us out, how to say no to users and yes to features of real value, and how to correctly harness the magic of low expectations to build something great.

## Goruco Submission

How do you grow a side project from a weekend hack into a steadily simmering product that delights users for years to come?

In the years after a friend and I created Wejoinin, we realized that what had started as a fun Rails side project had taken on a life of its own - an accidental startup. But did we really want to take the leap into becoming entrepreneurs? No way!

Instead, we chose to slow cook our side project. This talk is both a story and a practical guide to growing your passion project on your own terms, harnessing the power of your "no"s, yet saying "yes" to the things that excite you!

## Committee

This talk will begin with a story of how my friend and I wrote a Rails app while in university, building a product that solved our own problem. We then had other student groups use it, and soon enough we had a user base well beyond our expectations.

As we graduated and began our careers, we spent our free time maintaining the app and responding to our users' requests and customers. We always asked ourselves whether we wanted to make this a real business - but we never wanted to put ourselves in that kind of risk (nor did we want to sacrifice our personal lives).

Instead, we stayed laser-focused on our product. We said no to feature requests we didn't feel fit our vision. We did customer interviews and found pain points to solve. We turned down offers to buy us out. Because we were a side project, we never felt the pressure to sacrifice a weekend to deliver a feature. We focused on building with tech that was both bulletproof and proven (Rails) and also that was experimental and interesting to our personal tastes (Elm). We stayed frugal and penny-pinching, living on SaaS free tiers and learning to do things ourselves.

After giving the product away for free for 8 years, we recently began investigating how to monetize the platform. I'll talk about sane, non-evil ways to make a self-supporting platform, while still keeping user priorities #1.

10 years later, I still love what we do with this product. We've preserved our independence, but we feel confident knowing we solve a very real problem for a good number of our users. We scratch our technical itches from time to time. We have grown with every Rails release, and we've sharpened our technical skills over the years. That, I hope to communicate, is the power of a great side project.

 I'd love to have the opportunity to give this talk at Goruco!

 ## Pitch

This talk comes from experience spending 10 years of building a product on the side. That's 10 years of developer happiness rolling on nearly every major release of Rails. It's a side project with a long view, that can flex with the ebb and flow of life and personal interests. And I want the audience to also develop their own projects that are sustainable, interesting and deliver real value to people.

I've been speaking at meetups and conferences for a few years now on the topics of Rails, JS and Elixir. I recently gave an architecture talk at Railsconf (2017), and more recently at a few Elixir-focused conferences (Empex, Elixir Daze). I love inspiring folks to go home and try out new ideas.
