Sprouting Elm: Introducing Elm into legacy systems
==================================================

The case for introducing Elm is a powerful one - elegant syntax, a wonderful type system, a fantastic compiler and that promise of no runtime errors. As compelling as these reasons may be, we need low-risk ways to introduce Elm into legacy systems to allow the framework and language to make its case!

That's the challenge we faced at Wejoinin - we needed a way to evaluate the strengths of Elm while not risking our core application. How could I convince my partner that the merits of Elm were worth investigating with a lean proof of concept, inserted at just the right place in the application?

Join me as we discover the design process to developing a proof of concept that could be developed outside our main Rails application, yet integrated with ease. We'll discuss the tooling we used to develop an A/B test matrix and develop the metrics needed to evaluate the business case for new features built on our new Elm platform. In the end, you'll leave with new ideas to introduce Elm into whatever systems you develop in!
