# Increase Your Scope & Influence (Without Losing Your Soul)

Career advancement for the staff engineer is framed through the lens of expanding influence and scope - you may have growing technical oversight over more systems, or influence the long-term technical directions of multiple teams. But if you're like me, you're intimidated by the thought of growing influence, especially if it conjures up icky notions of politics and kingdom-building - yikes!

Here's some relief - it doesn't have to be this way! In this talk, we'll walk through some common misconceptions about influence and scope and re-frame it through the lens of opportunity and collaboration. We'll dive into what it takes to build trust with leadership and your peers, and discuss concrete ways to use your own unique talents to deliver impact where you are. Whether you're a staff engineer looking for advancement (or on your way there), you'll leave with a clear framework to grow your scope - and your career - wherever you are.

### Talk Relevance

Hi there, review committee, thanks for considering this talk.

For many of us who are senior engineers and looking to advance to staff+ engineering, the ladder to get there is ambiguous and unpaved. We know how to execute in our local domains where we are the local experts and authorities, but nobody has told us how to rise into positions of influence at the group or organization levels. In the absence of clear guidance, we may be intimidated by feeling like the levers of advancement are hidden to us. 

This was me over a year ago - as a senior engineer in a mid- to large-size company, I wanted to grow into a staff role but there was a chasm between where I knew I could perform and how I could grow my scope and influence in my group.

This is a story I believe will resonate to many senior engineers looking for career advancement but are missing a concrete framework for growth into a role that spans *multiple* teams, groups or organizations. Using my own story advancing into the Staff Engineer role, I want to equip the audience with their own toolkit for staff+ career advancement - using a win-win, collaborative approach:

We open by unpacking our fears around "expanding influence" - modern notions of being territorial, or being conniving, or image-obsessed like a social media influencer. The connotation is shallow.

But we contrast that by digging into the term "influence" and go to its latin roots: "in fluere" (into / to flow) - the image is of a rock changing the course of a stream. A gentle, irresistible force. Friends, this is what we want to be. 

How do we grow influence and scope? By being collaborative - and what follows are a few principles from my time as staff engineer, including:


* **Look for great problems**: Almost guaranteed there is a problem that the organization has not considered, or is unable to solve. Maybe there's a gap between the domains of two teams where incidents emerge. Maybe nobody is paying attention to observability, or tracking indicators for SLOs. Where do your strengths and skills map to unsolved problems in the organization? Look for these problems - and find a way to solve it. (For me, it was finding a gap in Web performance tooling and applying my time to build tools to solve it)
* **Find your customers**: If you're building a tool, who else would benefit from it? If you solved a problem on your team, could you socialize it with other teams? Use your written communication skills to circulate a design doc, or your informal networks to broadcast it in emails or presentations at an all-hands meeting.
* **Look for sunlight**: Like plants that grow, look for the light. You may be in the wrong team for growth opportunities. How can you find a way to get on projects that matter? You may need to transfer teams to get onto projects that have a big problem space, or heavy company focus. You may be misplaced in your role that does not match your skills. Concrete conversations with your manager may be needed. "Hey, I am great at $SKILL but I don't feel like I'm able to exercise it here. What can we do about that?" Manager may be able to help you look into a transfer, or look for projects they can help with.
* **Find sponsors through direct conversations**: My career did not truly accelerate until I met with two senior coworkers who I confided in my career aspirations. If our mentors do not know what we aspire for, we may miss opportunities for sponsors to help us out. Paradoxically, being direct about our aspirations helps them advance their own careers as they want to also be growing talent!
* **Start your squad**: Opportunities to lead are everywhere - look for places where you can show initiative to found or lead a group. I don't mean direct managerial responsibilities, but where you can lead a program (maybe an apprenticeship), or lead an architecture review committee, or even a book reading group. 
* **Love teamwork more than the work**: How are you helping others grow around you? Or do you take all the great work? Do you have a legacy of grooming great talent on your team and adjacent? Or do you let your teammates figure things out on their own? Word travels fast if you're a multiplier, a delegator and an enabler.
* **From zero-sum to win-win mentality:** We often assume that there is limited oxygen in the room, and the advancement of a peer is an advancement opportunity taken away from us. Counterpoint: Instead, take on a growth mindset and cheer on the success of your peers. After all, you may be needing their help
