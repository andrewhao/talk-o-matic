# TensorFlow For Tears

My life flipped upside-down when my son was born last year. In the overwhelming season that followed, I struggled with paternal postpartum depression. I coped the only way I knew how: by distracting myself with a side project. My goal was to train a TensorFlow model on a Raspberry Pi that would listen to hours of crying and tell me (quantitatively!) just how miserable I felt.

A funny thing happened: as I learned about the ins and outs of machine learning and TensorFlow, I also began developing more empathy and care for my son. Join me as I share how journeying through the stoic world of data led me to accept and celebrate my fragile, broken, and joyous humanity.
