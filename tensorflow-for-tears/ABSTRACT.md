# TensorFlow For Tears

My life flipped upside-down when my son was born last year. In the overwhelming season that followed, I struggled with paternal postpartum depression. I coped the only way I knew how: by distracting myself with a side project. My goal was to train a TensorFlow model on a Raspberry Pi that would listen to hours of crying and tell me (quantitatively!) just how miserable I felt.

A funny thing happened: as I learned about the ins and outs of machine learning and TensorFlow, I also began developing more empathy and care for my son. Join me as I share how journeying through the stoic world of data led me to accept and celebrate my fragile, broken, and joyous humanity.

I struggled with a season of paternal postpartum depression after my son's birth. Fortunately, I had my own coping mechanisms!  In my free time, I trained a TensorFlow model on hours of my baby's cries and got it to quantitatively measure our family's suffering.

Join me on my journey into machine learning (and fatherhood) as I learn about the ins and outs of machine learning and explore basic TensorFlow concepts with Python and Ruby. Will machine learning be a solace from the overwhelming demands of family life? Or will I ultimately learn to connect with my son and embrace my own fragile humanity?

This is both a highly personal story of how I struggled with postpartum depression after my son's birth. It's a (slightly) humorous take on a real, dark topic that I hope to shine a light on.

Of course, it's also a fun tour through the basics of machine learning and neural networks. It'll showcase some simple Python Tensorflow code (and also, time permitting, show off some Ruby Tensorflow.rb code), and some bash glue scripts to do waveform processing. I'll show how I trained my model on the never-ending cries of my little one and got it running on a Raspberry Pi in his living room, rendering a nice web dashboard that I check on every day while at work, wondering how much crying and suffering the little guy can wring.

(Don't worry - he's doing much better these days, so the talk ends on a happy note)

ML is taking over all of our industries, and it's more important than ever that developers understand the tools that are at their disposal. Fortunately, there are plenty of tools for the Rubyist. This talk aims to discuss one fun application of ML via TensorFlow, as well as tell a very human story of my struggles with postpartum depression and how, by listening to hours and hours of my son's crying, I needed to embrace and accept my broken humanity (rather than shove it off to a machine). ❤️
