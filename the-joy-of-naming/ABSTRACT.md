## Talk Abstract

Have you ever been confused by DDD and its jargon? Join the club. Today, we are going to look at DDD through a single, powerful lens - Naming. We’ll discuss how the concept of Using The Right Name drives all the underlying topics of DDD - and apply them to our software systems and teams!

## Talk Description

Have you ever been confused by Domain-Driven Design and its jargon? Join the club. DDD is a hairy, huge topic, yet its ideas are great for developing maintainable system architectures and scalable teams. It’s easy to get lost in the minutiae of patterns, code samples, and rambling articles without understanding its core principle: arriving at the same understanding of an entity, together with your teammates.

In this session, we will re-frame the topic through the lens of the Name. We’ll learn how the powerful concept of Using The Right Name drives all the underlying concepts of DDD. Together, we’ll explain a few core DDD design techniques and code patterns. We’ll also investigate how this changes the way our teams communicate - and find out if clear, consistent language and naming makes our teams work more productively and harmoniously!

## Notes

I’ve been involved in a project at Blurb where we attempted to break down a monolith into services. I began looking into DDD as a design technique to break down the system - and that’s the thinking that I want to explain here.

I’ve also developed a discipline on my client teams here to use consistent, clear, published language on our projects here. I have a couple of real-world scenarios, both good and bad, to share and hopefully help someone whose team needs the help.

Finally - I have adapted code samples and patterns online on a Github repo that I may use to help illustrate some concepts: http://github.com/andrewhao/delorean

Thank you organizers for your hard work!
