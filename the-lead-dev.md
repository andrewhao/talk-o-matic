Due: 10/28/2019

## Bio

Andrew is a software engineer at Lyft, where he leads a growth engineering team. Prior to that, he was at Carbon Five building software for all kinds of companies. Before that, he was an engineering manager at Blurb.

He is a recovering coffee addict, diehard runner, and reluctant Magna-Tile architect for his two-year-old son.

## We Are All Product Owners

When our product owner announced their departure earlier last year, our team was thrown into tumult. What would we do without a PM? How would we prioritize our growth goals against an ever-changing sea of company priorities? Who would manage stakeholders and priorities in a company as fast-moving as Lyft? The answer came surprisingly: no replacement was to be hired; instead the team would own its product direction!

Join me as we discover how shifting product ownership to the engineering team led to a revitalization of our mandate as product growth engineers. We&#39;ll discuss how the team utilized bottom-up rapid experimentation and a learning mindset to validate opportunities for the business. Together, the team developed skills in the ever-mystical art of relationship-building to communicate and influence effectively across the organization. And finally - gulp - the team continuously reported OKR progress in front of senior product leadership, celebrating wins and owning up to shortcomings.

Product ownership is both freeing and frightening, but learning to take it on is crucial to developing business-aligned, purposeful engineers. Whether or not you have a product owner, we will emerge with strategies for increasing engagement, ownership and product-mindedness on your engineering teams!

_How is your talk relevant to our audience?_

This talk gives tools for engineering leaders to build more product-savvy instincts for their engineering teams. It suggests tactics for stakeholder management and relationship-building within organizations, and it helps empower teams that feel that they do not have a say in product development. It is also bold in suggesting that some teams may not necessarily need product owners, provided they are supported in the right ways.

## Naming things is hard; linguistics to the rescue!

Have you ever waded through messy legacy code, confused and at a loss for understanding the meanings of obscure or outdated concepts? Felt slightly icky at naming a variable the way you did, or frustrated and boxed-in by the incapacity of your naming conventions to capture the true essence of what you&#39;re trying to convey in the business?

In this talk, we&#39;ll look to the field of linguistics and semiotic theory, which studies the communication of meaning. Together, we&#39;ll see how naming is an act deeply embedded in cultural context - the very culture of your software team!  We&#39;ll use a cultural lens to identify the challenges of communicating and building systems across your organization and beyond. We&#39;ll discover some cross-cultural tactics to apply to challenging tasks like designing APIs, sharing database stores, schema management, and refactoring legacy systems.

in order to build software in a large organization, we must make the implicit presence of culture explicit, codified in naming conventions, system design, documentation, and cross-team communication. You will emerge from this talk better equipped to design systems that harness the complex vocabulary of your business domain to build software with clarity and precision!

_How is your talk relevant?_

Software leads are on the hook for designing effective software architectures. While literature around architecture usually focuses on tactics - microservices, event pipelines, distributed systems - they fall short in thinking at a higher level of how architecture (and naming therein) communicates meaning.

This talk equips leaders to think about effective software naming through the lens of semiotics and communication theory, and develop a (cross-)cultural narrative by which their teams (and codebases) operate. We&#39;ll incorporate many ideas from Domain-Driven Design literature, which leads to better abilities to:

\* Embrace (don&#39;t avoid!) Conway&#39;s Law to build linguistic interfaces between software systems

\* Make implicit linguistic/naming assumptions explicit by developing Glossaries

\* Encode specific system modules to translate between cultural contexts (Anti-Corruption Layers, Bounded Contexts)

\* Communicate empathetically to neighboring teams (and even our future team-selves) by developing the documentation to explain ourselves and our current business contexts.


## Life after Extreme Programming: Lightweight Agile Practices For Skeptical Teams

Extreme Programming (XP) practitioners are oftentimes viewed with some amount of skepticism. &quot;Pair programming is amazing!&quot; they claim, &quot;and we TDD everything!&quot;. can seem overbearing, intimidating, and even hostile to teams that have a more traditional development background. Product and engineering leadership may also be skeptical to XP&#39;s claims of higher productivity with pairs of programmers.

If you believe in XP&#39;s benefits, but find some resistance to the practices of TDD, pair programming and pull-based workflows, then this talk is for you! We&#39;ll talk about lighterweight practices that embody the spirit of XP you can adapt to your organization. What are lightweight ways to convince engineers to give pairing a try? What do you need to interrogate about your engineering culture to understand resistance to test-driven development?

We&#39;ll talk about common objections from engineers, product leaders, and business stakeholders - and ways to adapt the best practices of XP into your organization using my own experience as an engineering lead at Lyft. In the end, we&#39;ll learn to see our engineering orgs as living, breathing organisms that we must first understand in order to offer new ideas for growth.



## _High Output Management_ for Non-Manager Leads!

What can a non-managing tech lead learn from Andy Grove&#39;s _High Output Management_ - one of the sacred texts of technology management and leadership? Though tech leads are usually not managing direct reports, they are uniquely positioned to benefit from Grove&#39;s advice due to their collaborative technical partnership with engineering and product management. In this talk, we&#39;ll explore:

- Understanding _output indicators_ for the team, and how you can brainstorm with your management partner for effective team health metrics
- What _leverage_ looks like for a tech lead, and its close relationship to the skill of _delegation_
- Why meetings are critical to team success, and how you can coach your teammates to make the most out of them
- Developing clear OKRs for the team by lending your deep technical expertise and product knowledge
- Understanding CUA - Complexity, Uncertainty, and Ambiguity - and partnering with engineering management to support different modes of top-down and bottom-up leadership

You will emerge from this talk equipped with the mindset of a manager, able to provide support to your engineering management counterpart to make your teams the best they can be!

_How is your talk relevant?_

When a technical lead has a manager mindset, they become exponentially more effective. This is because they can understand the challenges that engineering management face, particularly when it comes to motivation, measurement, decision-making and time-management.

I want all tech leads to develop this mindset, by letting Grove&#39;s principles in _High Output Management_ be our guide. Tech leads in the audience will be able to reframe their role on the team from just being a deep technical IC to an effective partner to management. The converse is true as well - I want managers to understand that they can lean on their tech leads to provide cover, deep insight and be a second set of eyes to all of their decisions and challenges. Teams that attend this talk together will have conversations sparked about how each role can support the other in accomplishing their mandates.# The Lead Dev
