### Life after Extreme Programming: Lightweight XP Practices For Skeptical Teams

Extreme Programming (XP) practitioners are oftentimes viewed with some amount of skepticism. "Pair programming is amazing!" they claim, "and we TDD everything!". can seem overbearing, intimidating, and even hostile to teams that have a more traditional development background. Product and engineering leadership may also be skeptical to XP's claims of higher productivity with pairs of programmers.

If you believe in XP's benefits, but find some resistance to the practices of TDD, pair programming and pull-based workflows, then this talk is for you! We'll talk about lighterweight practices that embody the spirit of XP you can adapt to your organization. What are lightweight ways to convince engineers to give pairing a try? What do you need to interrogate about your engineering culture to understand resistance to test-driven development?

We'll talk about common objections from engineers, product leaders, and business stakeholders - and ways to adapt the best practices of XP into your organization using my own experience as an engineering lead at Lyft. In the end, we'll learn to see our engineering orgs as living, breathing organisms that we must first understand in order to offer new ideas for growth.

### We Are All Product Owners: A Growth Engineering Mindset

When my product owner announced their departure earlier last year, our team was faced with tumult and chaos. What would we do without a PM? How would we prioritize our growth goals against an ever-changing sea of company priorities? Who would manage stakeholders and know what would be important? The answer came surprisingly - no replacement was coming - the team would own everything, product hat and all. Little did I know that this shift would be one of the best things to happen to our careers.

Join me as we discover how shifting product ownership to the engineering team led to a sea change in our team's attitudes about everything we did. We'll discuss how we utilized rapid experimentation and a validation focus to learn quickly and validate opportunities for the business. We'll go over some tools to use to keep the team aligned on priorities. We will learn some tools in the ever-mystical art of relationship-building and see how hybrid product growth engineers can communicate and influence effectively across their organizations. And finally - gulp - we'll talk about owning our OKRs in the truest, deepest sense.

In the end, you will emerge with strategies for increasing engagement and product-mindedness on your engineering teams, whether you have a product owner or not!
